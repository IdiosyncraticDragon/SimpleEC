This is a simple Implementation of Evolutionary Computation

GA.m, PSO.m, EDA.m, DE.m contain the algorithms and the RunExperiment1.m is the main file. The RunExperiment1.m will invoke the algorithmsin sequence.

And the other files are the benchmark functions and dataset.
README.txt introduces the benchmarks.
